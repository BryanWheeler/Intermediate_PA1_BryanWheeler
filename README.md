This program takes 3 points, 9 coordinates, inputted by the user.  The points are then run through a function
that will compute and return the area inside the triangle formed by the three points.  In the computeArea function a
distance function is called to find the distance between each point and then used in the Heron's Formula for finding
area of a triangle on a 3-dimensional plane.  The program then outputs the result of the computeArea function to the
console to show the user.  Lastly the program exits.
